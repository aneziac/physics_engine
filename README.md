**physics_engine** is a 2D physics engine and editor featuring simulations at multiple scales. It was created as a hobbyist project.

# Features
- Time controls (Note that this is a work in progress to be fixed soon.)
- Customizable objects
- Laws of physics including orbits, drag, conservation of momentum, buoyancy etc.

# Running
To run the engine, simply run ``main.py``. General settings can be changed in ``data/settings.py`` and the simulation can be changed in ``data/sims.py``. You can change which material is used for each object by selecting one from ``data/materials.py``. See the documentation for variable and function uses to customize simulations further.
